/* Participation Project 05
* COMPLETED 1-30-25
*
* Prompts the user to enter a positive integer (>0)
* You must display a message with instructions
* Do not re-prompt the user if they enter an invalid number, just accept what they entered
*
* Using a recursive function named print_factors, finds and prints al
* factors of the provided integer in descending order, one per line
* Use modulo math: 49 % 7 = 0 means 7 is a factor of 49, and 49 % 5 = 4 means 5 is not
* If value to be factored is â‰¤0, don't output any factors
*
