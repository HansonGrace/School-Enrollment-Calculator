#  School Enrollment Growth Estimator

This project estimates future school enrollment trends using basic statistical modeling. It prompts users for target enrollment values, calculates annual growth rates, and prints projections across decades. Originally designed as a C programming assignment for CS 350 at West Virginia University, it demonstrates foundational skills in C, including user input validation, math operations, file structure, and unit testing.
